- species_sigs-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz

Species-level signatures for most organisms (available bacteria and
archaea). Contains files for each species, organized by GenBank
taxonomy ID. The 3 longest stretches of consecutive 18mer signatures
are given for each species. The signatures are filtered to include
only those with 70 > gc% > 30.

Files are in FastA format, however sequence data does not contain
newlines. Headers are of the form:

>GenBank_accession[start,end] signature_length organism_name

Current version built on older database and may not contain as many
sequences as the website. Signatures have not been screened against a
RefSeq background, only against other bacteria and archaea.
